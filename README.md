## 🧭 Overview

**MyNneFarm** is a web-based agri-finance platform that enables urban Nigerians and Nigerians in the diaspora to invest in real farms, support rural farmers, and earn **Food Credits** at harvest.

These credits can be:

- 🍚 Redeemed for **discounted food**
- 💵 Exchanged for **cash** (with small transaction fees)
- 💰 **Saved** for future food security

Our mission is to **bridge the gap** between food producers and urban consumers while creating economic opportunities for all stakeholders.
